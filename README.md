# Image-Reconstruction-from-Split-Chunks


Introduction

In scenarios where large images are split into smaller chunks for storage or processing, reconstructing the original image can be challenging. This project aims to automate the process of joining these split image chunks into a complete image.

Features

Automatic Image Reconstruction: Automatically detects and arranges image chunks.

Supports Various Image Formats: Handles JPEG, PNG, BMP, and other common image formats.

Configurable Grid Size: Allows for custom grid sizes to specify how images were originally split.

Setup and Requirements

Python Version: 3.x

Dependencies:

Pillow

NumPy

OpenCV (optional for enhanced image manipulation)

Install the required packages using pip:

bash

Copy code

pip install pillow numpy opencv-python

Usage

You can use this script either via command line or a Jupyter notebook.

Command-Line Usage

Organize Split Images: Place the split images in a directory. Ensure they are named in a sequential manner or can be identified by their position.



Run the Script: Use the following command to reconstruct the image:




bash


Copy code
python reconstruct_image.py --input_dir <path_to_split_images> --output_file <output_image_file> --rows <num_rows> --cols <num_cols>

--input_dir: Directory containing the split images.


--output_file: Path to save the reconstructed image.

--rows: Number of rows in the grid.

--cols: Number of columns in the grid.

Notebook Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook: Use the provided Reconstruct_Image_Notebook.ipynb notebook.



Run the Cells: Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your images, set the grid size, and reconstruct the image.



Detailed Process

Loading the Images: The script reads all image chunks from the specified directory.

Sorting the Chunks: The images are sorted based on their filenames or metadata to determine their correct position in the grid.

Creating the Grid: An empty NumPy array or Pillow image is created to hold the final image.

Placing Chunks: Each image chunk is placed in its corresponding position in the grid.

Saving the Image: The complete image is saved to the specified output file.

Example

Let's consider you have a directory of images split into 3 rows and 3 columns:






Images: image_0_0.png, image_0_1.png, image_0_2.png, ..., image_2_2.png



Command to run the script:



bash

Copy code

python reconstruct_image.py --input_dir ./split_images --output_file ./complete_image.png --rows 3 --cols 3
The script will join these 9 images into a single image and save it as complete_image.png.
